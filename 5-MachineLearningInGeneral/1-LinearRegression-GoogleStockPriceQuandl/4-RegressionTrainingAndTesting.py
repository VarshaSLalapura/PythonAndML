# we found the features and the labels of the Google stock prices dataset from Quandl
# we need to show it to a classifier , train and test
# before that we need to preprocess the data, using sklearn,
# preprocessing or scaling between -1 and 1 will improve acc and processing speed.
# thisnk of SGD, if the planes are in 0 to 1 its a pleasant nice trace to pass down hill,
# if the numbers are all over, then how to get there downm it woud probably not converge at all or slowly after a
# really long pre-processing


# we will import numpy to represent data as arrays, python has it as a list and not arrays
