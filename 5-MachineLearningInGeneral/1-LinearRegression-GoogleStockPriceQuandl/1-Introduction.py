# Practical Machine Learning
#
# ML history and development and boon and bane

# Machine Learning definition: "Feild of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly
# programmed "

# History:
# Arthur Samuel defined ML as above in 1959

# One of the largest challenges I had with machine learning was the abundance of material on the learning part.
# You can find formulas, charts, equations, and a bunch of theory on the topic of machine learning, but very
# little on the actual "machine" part, where you actually program the machine and run the algorithms on real data.

# SVM was by Soviet Union guy called Valdimir Vapnik
# NN in 1940, machines were poor , inefficient


# "core of ML is simple it has to be because it scales to a very large dataset"

# With the defaults from Scikit-learn, you can get 90-95% accuracy on many tasks right out of the gate.
# Machine learning is a lot like a car, you do not need to know much about how it works in order to get an incredible
# amount of utility from it. If you want to push the limits on performance and efficiency, however, you need to dig in
# under the hood, which is more how this course is geared.
